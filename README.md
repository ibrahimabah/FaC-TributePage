Learning To build a simple page using HTML, CSS & JS at [Founders and Coders](https://account.foundersandcoders.com/apply/projects)

## Project Requirements

- [x] The page has a title which informs the user what the site is about
- [x] The page has a logical layout and clear structure
- [x] There are images on the page, with alt-text where appropriate
- [x] The page is visually interesting, for example with borders or colours
- [x] A list is visible somewhere on the page
- [ ] Everything on the page fits on any screen size, without content overflowing or being cut off
- [ ] A user can click on a link that takes them to another website
- [ ] The page has a header element, and a footer element
- [ ] Somewhere on the page, the user can see today’s date. The date should always be correct. You’ll need to use JavaScript to generate the date, and DOM manipulation to display it.
